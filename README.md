# Hygieia POC

Hygieiaâ„  is a single, configurable, easy to use dashboard to visualize near real-time status of the entire delivery pipeline. For more information on Hygieia please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/capitalone/Hygieia) and [CapitalOne DEVEXCHANGE](https://developer.capitalone.com/opensource-projects/hygieia/).

Hygieia was being researched as a possible solution for issue life cycle management and monitoring. This would provide a mechanism to provide traceability from a specific project JIRA issue creation and link this to specific Git repository code commit. It would also provide a way to monitor and link all related DevOps components like static code analysis (SonarQube) and build tools (i.e. Jenkins). The following documentation walks through configuring and some of the issues setting up and running the Hygieia dashboard.

All the components for Hygieia were installed via docker. Each component to run Hygieia must be first built with maven then a docker build can be executed to build the image and add the application properties. The only component that didn't require a maven build is the Mongo database.
If you follow the guides you should be able to get this up and running. I did run into a few issues along the way but most of them were configuration issues and were identified from debugging the logs. One issue I did encounter was with configuring the SonarQube Hygieia collector. It would not hook in and after debugging it was due to the source code for the collector was not compatible with the version of SonarQube I was using. There was an update that resolved this issue a couple weeks later and I was able to hook this in.

Due to the complexity of the configuration I deployed all the applications and collectors with docker. Then developed a docker-compose.yml file and push this to github https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo.git along with the Mongo db data volume. All the corresponding docker images were committed and pushed up to dockerhub. To reproduce the POC please use the following steps:
Note: you will need Docker and docker-compose installed along with Git.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo.git
Cloning into 'hygieia-demo'...

```

Now go into the hygieia-demo directory and run "docker-compose up -d" This part will take a few minute because it will need to download all the docker images and start up the applications:

```bash
$ cd hygieia-demo/
[hygieia-demo]$ docker-compose up -d 
WARNING: The Docker Engine you're using is running in swarm mode.
 
Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.
 
To deploy your application across the swarm, use `docker stack deploy`.

```

Now you can go to a browser and enter the following to access the Hygieia dashboard:
http://${docker-host-ip-address}:8088 
This will bring you to the Hygieia dashboard:

![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/dashboard1.png)

You can login hto the dashboard by selecting the Login button:![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/blob/master/loginbutton.png) on te upper right pane of the screen:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/login.png)

The username is "user" and password is "password"
Then select the Consumer Application dashboard under all dashboards:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/calogin.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/cadashboard.png)

Now you can log into Jenkins: http://${docker-host-ip-address}:8090
username: admin
password: password

![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jenkinslogin.png)

Select the ConsumerApplication project:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jenkinsdashboard.png)

Then click build now on the left pane:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jenkinsproject.png)

You should see build 7 pop up:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jenkinsprogress.png)

Select the status bar and this will bring you to the console output:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jenkinsconsoleoutput.png)

Once the build is complete it will take up to 5 mins to sync with the Hygieia Dashboard. You should now see a Build 7:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/hygieia-jenkins.png)

You can also log into JIRA at http://${docker-host-ip-address}:8081:
user: admin
password: password
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jiralogin.png)

Go to the ConsumerApplicationKanban project:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jiraproject.png)

Create a new issue using the create button on the top navigation pane. 
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jiracreate1.png)

Enter a Summary and description for the new issue and select create:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/jiracreate2.png

You should now see the issue appear in the Hygieia dashboard under the Feature widgets "issues in progress":
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/hygieia-jira.png)

The code repo widget by default for this POC is hooked into https://github.com/jrduff3/consumerapplication.git. You can configure another repo by selecting the configuration icon(![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/settings.png)) and update the configuration for another GitHub repo:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/gitconfig.png)

The POC also has SonarQube server and the widget configured. To access SonarQube Server go to http://${docker-host-ip-address}:9000 and login:
username: admin
password: admin
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/sonarqubelogin.png)

Select projects and show all projects:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/sq1.png)

The ConsumerApplication project is the analysis pushed from the Jenkins build:
![alt text](https://github.com/jrduff3/hygieia-demo/images/blob/master/sq2.png)

This information shows up in the Hygieia's Quality widget, currently this project does not have any code coverage but the lines analyzed should match up:

### Mongo Database:
The Mongo database holds the collections from all the collectors. If the git commits contain the JIRA issue key in the commit message it would be possible to link this data and create a new dashboard widget to show the traceability. Here is an example of the document for the different types of collections to show what data is available:
